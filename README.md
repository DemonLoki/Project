# The Travel Bucket List

## About

I chose the brief of the Travel Bucket List for my
project, and I aim to have a site detailing some
popular cities to travel to, as well as detail popular
destinations and tourist spots, average flight costs,
average hotel prices, and some information about
the cities themselves.
To do this and to build this site, I have used HTML
formatting alongside CSS code for the design, and JavaScript
with Express added in for the server setup and to make
the pages fuction properly.
